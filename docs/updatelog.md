## Dark Skies Update
### 0.2.7

Reading these (x/y/z) statements are the default config values that are different across the new preset systems. X = Classic, Y = Death World, and Z = Dark Forest.

- Split Radiogenics Config into 4 categories:
  - Wyrms
  - Creeped
  - Follies
  - Global (Affects Wyrms, Creeped, and Follies alike)
- New config options for Radiogenics:
  - Wyrms:
    - **Drop pods cause block damage** (false/true/true)
  - Creeped:
    - **Immune to Explosions** (false/true/true)
    - **Immune to Cacti** (false/false/false)
    - **Immune to Falling** (false/false/true)
  - Global:
    - **Mob Easter Eggs** (true/true/true)
- Wyrms in classic mode are now only immune to falling
- Creeped mobs made into a unified class (That is technical speak for "they now have their own properties")
- Drop pods can now destroy blocks upon landing in Death World and above difficulties
- Unified more drop pod code for consistency
- Visitor-originating Callous Landing Pods now spawn rovers and soldiers instead of probers
- Moved more rendering code to be client-side only
- Evolution decays ~66% faster (but still respects minimum evolution rules)
- Removed some unused code
- Visitor no longer gets pushed by its own drop pods
- Visitor drops pods further away from each other
- Improved code for wyrms exploding on death while on fire
  - This should reduce the amount of code in the mod
  - Added internal (invisible) potency stat.
  - Wyrms with 0 potency will not violently explode at death, but provide no evolution points upon death as well.
  - Wyrms, regardless of the configuration rules, will still contribute evolution points on death, so long as they have potency.
- New "potency" stat in wyrms
  - Determines if the mob explodes on death via fire
  - Also determines if the entity has (and how much) evolution points to contribute upon death.
    - If potency is at least 20 or more, every 20 points and after is +1 evolution point added.
  - Potency stats of wyrms:
    - Visitor: 100 (5 evo points on death)
    - Creepwyrm: 45 (2 evo points on death)
    - Soldier: 15
    - Warrior: 10
    - Vanitas: 6
    - Myrmur & Biter: 4
    - Worker: 3.5
    - Rover: 3
    - Wyrmling: 1.5
    - Creepling: 1.25
    - Prober: 1
  - All drop pods have a potency of zero
  - Wyrm explosion power decreased in most cases
