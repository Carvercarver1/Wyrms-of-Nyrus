## Dark Skies Update
### 0.3

This update is potentially incompatible with old worlds or may cause a few issues when updating.

Reading these (x/y/z) statements are the default config values that are different across the new preset systems. X = Classic, Y = Death World, and Z = Dark Forest.

- Split Radiogenics Config into 4 categories:
  - Wyrms
  - Creeped
  - Follies
  - Global (Affects Wyrms, Creeped, and Follies alike)
- New config options for Radiogenics:
  - Wyrms:
    - **Drop pods cause block damage** (false/true/true)
  - Creeped:
    - **Immune to Explosions** (false/true/true)
    - **Immune to Cacti** (false/false/false)
    - **Immune to Falling** (false/false/true)
  - Global:
    - **Mob Easter Eggs** (true/true/true)
- Wyrms in classic mode are now only immune to falling
- Creeped mobs made into a unified class (That is technical speak for "they now have their own properties")
- Drop pods can now destroy blocks upon landing in Death World and above difficulties
- Unified more drop pod code for consistency
- Visitor-originating Callous Landing Pods now spawn rovers and soldiers instead of probers
- Moved more rendering code to be client-side only
- Evolution decays ~66% faster (but still respects minimum evolution rules)
- Removed some unused code
- Visitor no longer gets pushed by its own drop pods
- Visitor drops pods further away from each other
- Improved code for wyrms exploding on death while on fire
  - This should reduce the amount of code in the mod
  - Added internal (invisible) potency stat.
  - Wyrms with 0 potency will not violently explode at death, but provide no evolution points upon death as well.
  - Wyrms, regardless of the configuration rules, will still contribute evolution points on death, so long as they have potency.
- New "potency" stat in wyrms
  - Determines if the mob explodes on death via fire
  - Also determines if the entity has (and how much) evolution points to contribute upon death.
    - If potency is at least 20 or more, every 20 points and after is +1 evolution point added.
  - Potency stats of wyrms:
    - Visitor: 100 (5 evo points on death)
    - Creepwyrm: 45 (2 evo points on death)
    - Soldier: 15
    - Warrior: 10
    - Vanitas: 6
    - Myrmur & Biter: 4
    - Worker: 3.5
    - Rover: 3
    - Wyrmling: 1.5
    - Creepling: 1.25
    - Prober: 1
  - All drop pods have a potency of zero
  - Wyrm explosion power decreased in most cases
- Redone how entities are registered into the game
- Warrior tracking (and render) distance increased from 64 to 128
- Fixed soldier infectoid variant having lower tracking distance
- Increased Creepling tracking distance from 16 to 32
- New spawner items for wyrms
- Pod & Voidwyrm spawner items spawn their entities in the air
- Strykelings now spawn in the center of blocks
- Spawner items that fail to spawn an entity will spawn a Spider instead.
- Removed vanilla-style spawn eggs for wyrm mobs (with a few exceptions at the moment)
- Massive English language file update
- New descriptions for mobs
- Creepwyrms can no longer be pushed around and actually stay stationary on blocks.
- New debug mode messages related to evolution points being added and natural decay of evolution points. (Lever 5 debug mode or above needed)
- Killing wyrms with fire increases evo points gained by 2x (Dark Forest only, configurable in Evolution configurations)
- Updated Strykeling animations
- Wyrm stats are now persistent across world loads, including across sessions.
  - Fixed wyrm stats (health, armor, damage, etc.) only being saved to memory (RAM)
  - Before, just follies would do this.
  - Creeped also remember their stats
- Improved animation functions built upon Geckolib
  - Wyrms now use an Animation Array to define and pick out animations, therefore reducing the amount of work needed to define new animations
  - I thought the current system was a bit messy and hard to look at, so I fixed it (somewhat.)
- Creepwyrms that infest a certain number of blocks will now summon a new Creeped unit.
  - Classic difficulty: Will summon only biters
  - Death World difficulty: Will summon tier 1 Creeped (Biters, Creeplings)
  - Dark Forest difficulty: Will summon any Creeped
- Creepwyrms that make (10/8/7) successful summons will call forth (1/2/3) Creep Pods from the sky in a (30/45/100)-block radius.
- Increased the size of the Creepwyrm hitbox
- Creepwyrms now use their summoning animation
- New secrets
- Removed despawn timer references for Visitor
  - *Why was that still there?*
- Introducing new advancements:
  - **"How did we get here?"** 
  - **"KILL IT WITH FIRE!"**
  - **"A Splitting Migraine"**
  - **"Not Today!"**
  - **"Californium's Witness"**
- New AI abilities
  - Banishment
  - Smite
  - Wide-area Attack
- Soldiers now use a wide-range swipe attack
  - No animation for it yet!
- Wyrms now use an even more aggressive AI
  - This means if something interrupts them from chasing and attacking their current target, they will switch to another target.
  - Wyrms will be less forgiving when swarmed/interrupted
    - Wyrms gain positive potion effects
